# Smart Maps

Smart Maps is a simple React package that lets you integrate maps easily.
It contains a few componetns with mab embedded, using the known MapBox API. (So far only Basic Map is available).
By the way, Smart Maps is my first published package.

## Using the package

In order to use the package, simply run:
`npm install @levit0mer/smartmaps --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`

Or, you can also use an .npmrc file and add the following to it:
@levit0mer:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
Now just run `npm install @levit0mer/smartmaps`
